So far, we have created scenes in the editor (drag drop in 2d/3d view)

But this is't always possible in a game!
-> For example, the lasers are also a scene, but one that is dynamically generated!

How this works
1.) We need to create a scene (in the example we need to make nodes that constitue a Laser/Grenade)
2.) We need to create an instance of the scene (Scene = Blueprint, instance = a dsitinct node)
3.) We need to add the scene to the node tree ( we need to add the instance specifically)
