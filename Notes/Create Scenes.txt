So far, we have created scenes in the editor (drag drop in 2d/3d view)

But this is't always possible in a game!
-> For example, the lasers are also a scene, but one that is dynamically generated!

How this works
1.) We need to create a scene (in the example we need to make nodes that constitue a Laser/Grenade)
2.) We need to create an instance of the scene (Scene = Blueprint, instance = a dsitinct node)
3.) We need to add the scene to the node tree ( we need to add the instance specifically)



Local vs Global Postions

Position (the one we use normall) is a local position
-> That is to say they are relative to the parent.

Global Postions are an exact pixel coordinate that is independent from any parent
-> We are not in relation to the parent

EX 1
Image you are in your house:
-> You have some relative position to the center of the house (your local position) but you still have a specific GPS location(global position)

EX 2
You can add a Node2D with an offset of x:100 and y:200 and give it a child on the same position.
The child will have a local position of x:0 an dy:0, but a global position of x:100 and y:200
