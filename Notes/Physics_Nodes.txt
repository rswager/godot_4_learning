Area2d
-> An area that can check if another body entred
-> Can be moved by changing the position
->-> Ex An area to detect if a player has entered a house
->-> Ex An area will be attached to the Lasers

StaticBody2d
-> A static body that other bodies collide with
-> Not supposed to be  moved
->-> Ex Any static object: Walls, Beds, obstacles...etc

RigidBody2d
-> Moving body that moves via physics (like a cannonball)
-> Set an initial velocity
->-> Ex (later impilmented greneades)

CharacterBody2D
-> Moving body controlled by code
-> Inbuilt methods
->-> Ex Any entity that is controlled by code: The Player & all enemies.


Reccomendations to always keep the collision shape around the center, if possible

Typical Structures

Main Node
-> Image
-> Image, if more
-> Collision Shape
-> Collision Shape , if more

Example

Bed
-> Bed Image
-> Small Pillow Image
-> Large Pillow Image
-> CollisionShape

In Depth RigidBody2D

-> RidigBody2Ds have a gravity setting that is on by default! (gravity goes from top of screen to bottom of screen)
-> You can set physics behavior in the inspector and additional options are set via PhysicalMateria (Friction, Bouncing)
-> And you are only supposed to set a starting velocity, the movement is then influenced by physics
