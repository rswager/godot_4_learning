The Camera is pretty simple
-- It want's to be the child of the node it follows (the player!)

We get some weird jankieness. (camera is lagging behind)
- You can enable position smoothing and set the speed for the camera to follow the player

Camera Zoom (<1 zoom out:  >1 Zoom In)


WE CAN SET THE CAMERA LIMIT (can we do this dynamically later on?)
