Signals
-> When a certain action happens to a node:
->-> A body entering an Area
->-> A timer running out
->-> two bodies colliding

-> You can tell the affected node(s) to send a signal, which basically means that you are running a function

-> The ability to do this gives incredibly powerful ways to make nodes communicate with each other!


CUSTOMER SIGNALS
-> You can create your own signals!
-> The major limitation of singals is that they only work between nodes in the same scene.
-> Triggering customer signals can help to communicate between scenes
